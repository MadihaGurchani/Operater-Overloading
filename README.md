# Operater-Overloading
Write a program in C++ that add two class objects by overloading "plus(+)"operator. You are required to create a class named "MathClass" and declare the class member and member functions. Also declare a class data member named as "number" and a parameterized constructor which take one arguement and initialisezz the number. Define the "+" operator overloaded function to add two object's numbers. Also define another member function named as "Display()" that shows the calculation result. Create three class objects for example: obj1, obj2, and result. Values are passed by calling the parameterized cconstructor in main() function. Add two object values by calling the "+" operator overloaded function and then display () function using obj1, obj2 and result.
